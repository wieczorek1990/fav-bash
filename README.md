fav_bash
===

### This is quite old and you should use [fav_ruby](https://github.com/wieczorek1990/fav_ruby) instead.

This is a bash script that creates a music playlist in xspf format with location values from your last.fm loved tracks xspf file. You need xmlstarlet and python-mutagen for this to work.
